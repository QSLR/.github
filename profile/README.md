Quickseller.
We're a small business founded in 2020 by 4 founders. Two of them are interested in tech. Hence the GitHub page, although we sell stuff.
We've just learned to use Quickseller as a business name.
But it's the parent company.
The founders are currently learning Python and JavaScript for an upcoming project.
If you want to see what we're doing, check out MysticalsEnd on GitHub.
